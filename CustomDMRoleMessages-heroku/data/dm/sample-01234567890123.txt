This is a sample message - You may use this file for reference. Make sure each role's custom messages are stored in this same /data/dm directory with the corect filename.  The contents of this message would be sent as the body of an embed to the DM of the member.

The file name must include the role_id

**Quick reference**:
The markdown syntax supported by Discord applies to this txt content as well since it's rendered by discord before being sent to the channel.
Embed body text may include links (similar to Reddit)

Italics - * *  | This is a *sample* sentence ("sample" would be italicized)
Bold -  ** **  | This is a **sample** sentence ("sample" would be bold)
Strikethrough - ~~ ~~ | This is a ~~sample~~ sentence ("sample" would have a strike through it's middle)
Links - [The disply link text](https://some-link-to-somewhere.com) | [The display link text] would appear as a clickable link directed to https://some-link-to-somewhere.com


**Emojis**:

Native supported emojies can be added by using the :emoji_name: syntax | :thumbsup: would show the thumbsup emoji
Custom guild emojies can also be used with the <:emoji_name:emoji_id> syntax | Find it easily by sending the emoji to a channel, but placing a \ in front of the icon before sending.  The resulting message can be copy/pasted into this txt file
Custom guild animated emojies can also be used with the <a:emoji_name:emoji_id> syntax | Find it easily using the same method for custom guild emojies
